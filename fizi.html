 <h1>My Family</h1>
<p>My Name is Muhammad Hafizi bin Mohd Aspar . I live in Seksyen 7.</p>
<h1>My Family</h1>
<p>
There are five people in my family including me.I have an older brother and an older sister.My mother works as a factory worker for a factory called MediTop.My father works as a police.My brother is also on his way to become a police offcier himself while my sister is working in the same company as my mother.Everyday, my mother cooks food for breakfast and lunch and sometimes it's enough for dinner as well because she has to go to work at dawn and return homme at dusk.Although our financially situation isn't good, my mother always give me things that I needed.I love my family so much.
</p>
 
<h1>My School</h1>
<p>
my school was called SMK Jalan Empat.The school is located in Bandar Baru Bangi.School this year was a little bit special because we learn using an online app called google meet.In the early days of the pandemic,I have was having a hard time focusing in class because I have my phone on the tip of my hand.Now, I have accostumed to learn in an online class but after the vaccine has been provided by the government, school days is going back to normal once again. I hope that I can achieve my dream while learning in this school.

<h1>My Pet</h1>
<p>
I have 3 kinds of pet but what one has been released because it's size is too large for our family to buy a comfortable container.It is a tortoise.My second pet is a school of fish.Although it's my sister who takes care of them.Lastly, the third pet is cats.I have three cats, two of them was found by my brother while they're still a kitten.They also didn't have a mother.I always play with them in the pandemic because I can't go outside.
</p>
 
<h1>My Music</h1>
<p>
These days I've been listening to an american rapper called NF.He has releases a few album such as The Search,Therapy Session and Perception.I like his song because it has a lot of meaning since he wrote his song based on his experience in life.He also didn't use swear words in his song.He once make a song based on his mother drug addiction that led to her death.The song was so sad because he shows his anger to his mother who leave him and his sibling too early.My favourite song was named WHY because he use a different flow to rap.
